# Base_Coverter
The Base converter App In Python is a simple project developed using Python. The project contains a base conversion system and calculator. The user can enter any number and convert them to any number systems(like decimal to binary, binary to octal, etc.

->Decimal to Binary
An easy method of converting decimal to binary number equivalents is to write down the decimal number and to continually divide-by-2 (two) to give a result and a remainder of either a “1” or a “0” until the final result equals zero. So for example. Convert the decimal number 29410 into its binary number equivalent.


How to convert from octal to decimal
A regular decimal number is the sum of the digits multiplied with 10n.

Example #1
137 in base 10 is equal to each digit multiplied with its corresponding 10n:

13710 = 1×102+3×101+7×100 = 100+30+7

Octal numbers are read the same way, but each digit counts 8n instead of 10n.

Multiply each digit of the hex number with its corresponding 8n.

Example #2
37 in base 8 is equal to each digit multiplied with its corresponding 8n:

378 = 3×81+7×80 = 24+7 = 31

Example #3
7014 in base 8 is equal to each digit multiplied with its corresponding power of 8:

70148 = 7×83+0×82+1×81+4×80= 3584+0+8+4 = 3596
